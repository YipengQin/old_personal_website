## Biography

I am a Lecturer (~Assistant Professor) in the School of Computer Science and Informatics, Cardiff University and a member of the <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science/research/groups/visual-computing" target="_blank">Visual Computing research group </a>. I am a Fellow of HEA.

I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronic Engineering from <a href="http://www.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, China, in 2013. Later in 2017, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href="https://ncca.bournemouth.ac.uk/" target="_blank">National Centre for Computer Animation (NCCA)</a>, Bournemouth University, UK. From Nov. 2017 to May 2019, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the <a href="https://vcc.kaust.edu.sa/" target="_blank">Visual Computing Center (VCC)</a> at KAUST, Saudi Arabia.

## Research Interests

My research interests are centered around machine learning (ML) and its applications in computer vision (CV), computer graphics (CG), human-computer interactions (HCI), etc. My current research revolves around the following three themes:

* **Unboxing the deep learning black-box**, which aims to understand the training dynamics of various deep neural networks, e.g. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
* **Creative Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, including GAN inversion, region-wise image disentanglement for diverse and controllable image synthesis/manipulation, etc.
* **Prototyping wearable devices for motion monitoring and analysis**, which aims to model the relationships between sensor signals and human motion using machine learning. This is collaborative research with Prof. Shihui Guo from Xiamen University, China.

I am also interested in other related topics like semantic segmentation, domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning, etc.
